# Time Series Analysis for Covid-19 using LSTM

From March 2020, the world has seen a major shift in dynamics. We saw the upsurge of Covid-19, which caused a global crisis. This project focuses on the analysis of Covid-19 dataset.

### The project is divided into 2 parts:
1. Exploratory data analysis 
2. Time series forecasting using long short-term memory (LSTM)

## Dataset used:
I have used 2 different datasets for the divided tasks:
##### 1. NYC Coronavirus Disease data (https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data)
##### 2. Covid19 Global Forecasting data (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/covid19-global-forecasting-week-4/data)
